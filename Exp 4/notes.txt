Redefine how ExecutionUnit works
Make all the units independent
    - Instruction Fetch
    - Instruction Decode
    - Execution
    - Memory
    - Write Back

Make an instruction Queue

The units should have a way of determining if they are free or not 
(if not free and then continue executing all that can continue and when space is available switch out)

Have a clock that progresses one click at a time (basically define a step function so that one step is one clock)

Ignore DATA HAZARDS for now and focus on STRUCTURAL HAZARDS
