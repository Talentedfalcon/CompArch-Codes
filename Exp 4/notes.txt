Completed:
    - Redefine how ExecutionUnit works
    - Make all the units independent [#Made as independent if calls]
        - Instruction Fetch
        - Instruction Decode
        - Execution
        - Memory
        - Write Back
    - The units should have a way of determining if they are free or not (if not free and then continue executing all that can continue and when space is available switch out)
    - Have a clock that progresses one click at a time (basically define a step function so that one step is one clock) [#Done at the end of the while loop]
    - Ignore DATA HAZARDS for now and focus on STRUCTURAL HAZARDS [#DATA HAZARDS completely ignored because scheduling is static]
    - Make a good terminal output (one which can be easily understood)
    - Make some interesting examples

Remaining Work:
    Implement Forwarding

Bonus Stuff:
    Have the registers actually store values
    Perform the calculations
